tpmiddle-rs
===========

`tpmiddle-rs` is a Rust port of [tene0/tpmiddle](https://github.com/tene0/tpmiddle) with some improvements.

## Features

### Lightweight

It doesn't need ThinkPad TrackPoint Keyboard software since it directly communicates with the keyboard.
You only need a `tpmiddle-rs.exe`.

### Configure the keyboard with CLI

It sends commands to the keyboard on its startup to set following configurations:

  * `--fn-lock` enables fn lock (`--no-fn-lock` to disable it).
  * `--sensitivity 1-9` sets TrackPoint sensitivity.

### Smooth scrolling (Experimental)

It disables native middle button on its startup to intercept all middle button events.
You can set scrolling controller by passing `--scroll <controller>` options to the program.

 * `classic`: It just bypasses middle button events. It would feel same with ThinkPad preferred scrolling.
 * `smooth`: It tries to smoothen discrete middle button events.
